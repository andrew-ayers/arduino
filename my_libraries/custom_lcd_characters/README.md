# Custom HD44780 Character Symbols #

### Description ###

This is more a library than a project. In the various C files you'll find a variety of defined characters meant for use in HD44780 character LCDs (and compatible LCDs that allow custom characters).

They are meant to be used with the LiquidCrystal and similar Arduino libraries, but are simple enough to likely be repurposed for anything.
