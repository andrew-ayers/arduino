# ANET 20x4 LCD Button Handler Library  #

### About ###

This is a library to allow easy interfacing and checking of button presses on the ANET 20x4 LCD. An example is provided that allows you to navigate and show all the characters the LCD can generate, by using the buttons to adjust the upper and lower nybbles of the character to be displayed (the center button resets the byte value to zero).
