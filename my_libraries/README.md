# My Arduino Libraries #

### About ###

Here you will find various libraries I have created for use with the Arduino. Just copy them to your Arduino libraries folder as usual, and restart your Arduino IDE, and they should appear in the menu.

WARNING: 

An exception here to the above is the "custom_lcd_characters". This isn't a standard library and should NOT be copied in the Arduino libraries folder (I doubt it would work properly).
